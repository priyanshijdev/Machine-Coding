* Each tab represents a different section or category of content.
* Clicking on a tab activates it and displays its associated content.

#### 2. **Active Tab Highlighting**

* The selected or active tab is visually highlighted (e.g., different color, underline).
* This helps users identify which tab is currently open.

#### 3. **Tab Content Area**

* Displays the content corresponding to the active tab.
* Only the content for the selected tab is shown; others are hidden.
